# main.py
# The maestro of this whole symphony. Conducts the SQL scripts in the right order.
# If you mess this up, the whole orchestra goes out of tune.
# Usage:
#   1) Don't just stand there, make sure your .env file has the database credentials.
#      The run.sh script can hold your hand through it if you're scared.
#   2) python main.py -- and pray it works.
